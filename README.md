# CS416 Sound Portfolio - Irvin Lu

A student portfolio containing all the assignments, activities, and projects performed as part of CS416P - Computers, Sound and Music
(Fall 2024) instructed by Bart Massey at Portland State University.

- All programs written throughout the course are contained in the [**`code`**](code) directory.
- An engineering notebook containing detailed diary entries on projects and discoveries is located in [**`notebook.md`**](notebook.md).
- A collection of personal notes taken during class lectures live in [**`lectures.md`**](lectures.md).

## Chiptune Synthesizer - Course Project

The overall course project I chose to do is a _Chiptune Synthesizer_, which takes in an input MIDI and "converts" the audio to a chiptune style, synthesizing basic waveforms based on each note's data. The project directory is located at the following link:

- [**_`Chiptune Synthesizer`_**](code/chiptune-synthesizer/)

## Portfolio Objectives

The following code projects were assigned by the professor as part of the course.

- [_`Clipped`_](code/clipped)
- [_`Adaptive Tone Control`_](code/tone-control)
- [_`Popgen`_](code/popgen)

## Self Projects

The following are additional code directories outside of the overall project and portfolio objectives. These programs were a result of
satisfying my own curiosity and application of concepts that I wanted to experiment with.

- [_`Spectrogram`_](code/spectrogram-fun/)
- [_`Piano Note to Frequency`_](code/note-to-frequency/)
- [_`Envelope ADSR`_](code/envelope-adsr/)
