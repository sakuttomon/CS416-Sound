# Popgen: Play a Pop Music Loop - Irvin Lu

Bart Massey 2024, extended by Irvin Lu. This program is an extension of the [`pdx-cs-sound/popgen`](https://github.com/pdx-cs-sound/popgen) as part of the "Popgen" portfolio objective.

This Python program generates a pseudo-melody using chord and bass notes from the
[Axis Progression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/axis_progression).

Right now, the controls are limited and the output is pretty terrible.

A sample is available in [`demo.wav`](demo.wav).
