# (_Experiment_) Spectrogram Plotting - Irvin Lu

This `fft-spectogram.py` is a prototype of my own volition, where I test out with how Fast Fourier Transform is applied in the
digital audio landscape.

This code was written as a result of my research through the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.specgram.html) and [Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.get_window.html) libraries in a personal
attempt to better visualize how FFT breaks down a signal and provides frequency information. By extension, I also looked into how
window functions factored into this application of a discrete fourier transformation.
